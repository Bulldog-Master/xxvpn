# Security Fixes Applied - Complete Summary

## Issue Addressed
**[ERROR] Customer Payment Data Exposed Without Protection**

The `subscription_monitoring` view was flagged as a security risk because views cannot have Row-Level Security (RLS) policies directly.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Vulnerable View
Dropped the `subscription_monitoring` view that couldn't be secured with RLS.

### 2. Created Three-Tiered Access System

#### Tier 1: User Self-Service (Least Privileged)
**Function**: `get_user_subscription_safe()`
- **Who**: All authenticated users
- **Access**: Own subscription data only
- **Returns**: Status without Stripe customer IDs
- **Security**: Automatic user isolation via auth.uid()

```sql
-- Example usage
SELECT * FROM get_user_subscription_safe();
```

#### Tier 2: Admin Monitoring (Redacted)
**Function**: `get_subscription_monitoring(limit, offset)`
- **Who**: Admins and super admins only
- **Access**: All subscriptions with pagination
- **Returns**: Subscription data with `[REDACTED]` Stripe IDs
- **Security**: Role-based access control + redaction

```sql
-- Example usage
SELECT * FROM get_subscription_monitoring(100, 0);
```

#### Tier 3: Support Access (Fully Logged)
**Function**: `get_user_subscription_admin(user_id)`
- **Who**: Super admins only
- **Access**: Complete subscription details including Stripe IDs
- **Returns**: Full data for customer support
- **Security**: Super admin requirement + audit logging

```sql
-- Example usage (THIS IS LOGGED!)
SELECT * FROM get_user_subscription_admin('user-uuid-here');

-- Verify it was logged
SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
WHERE action = 'ADMIN_VIEW_STRIPE_ID' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### 3. Audit Trail Enhancement
Every access to Stripe customer IDs is now logged:
- **Action**: `ADMIN_VIEW_STRIPE_ID`
- **Logged Data**: Admin user ID, target user ID, timestamp
- **Purpose**: Accountability and breach detection

## Security Principles Applied

### Defense in Depth
1. **RLS on base table** - `subscribers` table has strict RLS
2. **Function-level authorization** - All functions check roles
3. **Audit logging** - Sensitive access is logged
4. **Data minimization** - Most functions redact Stripe IDs

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Users: See only their own status
- Admins: See monitoring data (redacted)
- Super admins: Full access (logged)

### Accountability
- All Stripe ID access requires super admin role
- Every access creates an audit log entry
- Logs include who, what, when

## Testing the Security

```sql
-- Test 1: User can only see their own data
SELECT * FROM get_user_subscription_safe();
-- Should return: 0 or 1 row (your own)

-- Test 2: Admin can see all subscriptions (redacted)
SELECT * FROM get_subscription_monitoring(10, 0);
-- Should return: Multiple rows with '[REDACTED]' Stripe IDs

-- Test 3: Super admin access is logged
SELECT * FROM get_user_subscription_admin('test-user-uuid');
SELECT * FROM audit_logs WHERE action = 'ADMIN_VIEW_STRIPE_ID';
-- Should show: Audit entry with admin_user_id = you
```

## Files Modified

### Database
- `supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_*.sql` - Migration files with security fixes

### Documentation
- `docs/PAYMENT_SECURITY.md` - Comprehensive security guide
- `docs/SECURITY_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Client Code
- `src/hooks/useSubscription.ts` - Updated to use safe RPC function

## Compliance Benefits

✅ **PCI DSS**: Stripe IDs are protected with role-based access  
✅ **GDPR**: Data minimization and access logging  
✅ **SOC 2**: Audit trail for sensitive data access  
✅ **ISO 27001**: Defense in depth and least privilege

## Recommendations

### For Developers
1. Always use `get_user_subscription_safe()` in client code
2. Never log Stripe customer IDs
3. Use `get_subscription_monitoring()` for admin dashboards
4. Only use `get_user_subscription_admin()` for customer support

### For Administrators
1. Regularly review audit logs for `ADMIN_VIEW_STRIPE_ID` actions
2. Verify only authorized super admins have the role
3. Investigate any unexpected Stripe ID access
4. Rotate Stripe API keys if breach suspected

### For Security Audits
1. Check RLS is enabled on `subscribers` table
2. Verify functions have proper authorization checks
3. Review audit logs for access patterns
4. Test that regular users cannot access Stripe IDs

## Summary

The security vulnerability has been completely remediated by:
1. Removing the unsecured view
2. Implementing function-based access with explicit authorization
3. Adding comprehensive audit logging for sensitive access
4. Creating clear documentation and testing procedures

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Customer payment data is now fully protected with defense-in-depth security controls.
